# ✨ Step 4: Polish & Improve (10 minutes)

Now that the game works, let's make it shine. Each of these is one prompt to Cursor.

## Pick a Few (or Do Them All!)

### Streaming Responses — Word by Word
Open chat (`Cmd+L`):
> ```
> Change the AI responses to stream word-by-word instead of appearing all at once.
> Use OpenAI's streaming API. The player should see the text being "typed out"
> in real-time, like a typewriter effect.
> ```

### Sound Effects
> ```
> Add subtle sound effects to the game using the Web Audio API (no external files):
> - A soft "whoosh" when the player sends a message
> - A gentle typing sound while the AI is responding
> - A magical chime when a new game starts
> ```

### Command History
> ```
> Add command history to the player input, like a terminal.
> Pressing arrow-up should show the previous command,
> arrow-down the next one.
> ```

### A Fourth Scenario
> ```
> Add a new scenario: "Zombie Jerusalem" 🧟 —
> A zombie apocalypse has hit Jerusalem. The player is a survivor
> navigating the Old City, finding supplies and other survivors.
> Write a creative system prompt for the AI in the same style as the other scenarios.
> ```

## 🎨 Visual Tweaks

Select any part of the CSS and press `Cmd+K` with any of these:
- "Add a subtle particle effect to the background"
- "Make the typing indicator more dramatic"
- "Add a screen-shake effect when something dramatic happens in the story"
- "Make the start screen title pulse with a neon glow"

✅ Your game is polished. Time to show it off — and push even further.
