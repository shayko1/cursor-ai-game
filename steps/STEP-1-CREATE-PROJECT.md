# 🚀 Step 1: Create the Project (5 minutes)

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-ai-game -- --template react-ts
cd my-ai-game
npm install openai
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — you'll see Vite's default welcome page.

That's it for the terminal. From here on out, Cursor does the work.
From this point forward, keep workshop/chat instructions in English but keep the game itself (all player-facing text) in Hebrew.

✅ You have a blank canvas. Now let's build a game on it.
