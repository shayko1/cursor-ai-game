# 🔧 Step 0: Getting Ready

## What You'll Need

### 1. Install Cursor
Head to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) and install it. It's free, and if you've ever used VS Code, you already know how it works — same editor, just with AI superpowers built in.

### 2. Install Node.js
Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and grab the LTS version. Verify it works:
```bash
node --version  # should be v18+
npm --version
```

### 3. Three Shortcuts That Change Everything

| Shortcut | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| `Cmd+L` | Opens AI chat — describe what you want in plain English |
| `Cmd+K` | Inline edit — select code, tell the AI what to change |
| `Tab` | Smart autocomplete — Cursor predicts what you want to type |

That's it. These three shortcuts are all you need to build an entire app.

### 4. (Optional) See the Finished Game
```bash
git clone git@github.com:shayk/cursor-ai-game.git
cd cursor-ai-game && npm install && npm run dev
```

✅ Ready? Let's build something.
