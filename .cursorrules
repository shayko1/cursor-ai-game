# Cursor AI Rules - כללים ל-AI של Cursor

## Project Context
This is a **Hebrew Text Adventure Game** built with React + TypeScript that uses OpenAI API.
It's a workshop starter project for Israeli developers learning to use Cursor + AI.

## Language
- UI text and game content should be in **Hebrew**
- Code comments can be in Hebrew or English
- Variable names and code should be in **English**

## Tech Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for bundling
- OpenAI SDK for AI integration
- No CSS frameworks - vanilla CSS with custom properties

## Architecture
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (state management)
- `src/services/` - External API services (OpenAI)
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and prompt templates

## Key Patterns
- State management via `useReducer` in `useGame` hook
- All AI communication goes through `src/services/openai.ts`
- Game scenarios defined in `src/utils/prompts.ts`
- RTL (right-to-left) layout for Hebrew

## When Adding Features
1. Define types first in `src/types/game.ts`
2. Add state management in `src/hooks/useGame.ts`
3. Create/update components in `src/components/`
4. If it involves AI, update prompts in `src/utils/prompts.ts`

## Important Notes
- API key is loaded via `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- This is a workshop project - keep code readable and well-commented
- Look for `🎯 CURSOR TASK` comments for extension points
- Game supports RTL Hebrew - test text direction
